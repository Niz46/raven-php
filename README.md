# Raven Trading - PHP conversion

--------------------------------

This project was generated by an automated conversion of index.html into a PHP template structure.
Project root: raven-trading-php

How to use:

 1. Unzip the archive into your desired location (e.g. /Users/favour/Documents/raven-trading-php)
 2. Install composer dependencies if needed: `composer install`
 3. Run built-in server for testing: `php -S localhost:8000 -t public`
 4. The home page is at / (renders src/views/pages/home.php inside the base layout)

Notes:

- Head tags remain largely unchanged and keep CDN asset references.
- Scripts extracted to footer.php and will be loaded at end of the page.
- Review and audit any external scripts before deploying to production.
